# kubernetes-testing

This is a testsuite for testing Kubernetes installations and deployments.

It can potentially be used for many different types of Kubernetes installations, but its main purpose is to test the successful installation of the [Swisscom DCS+ Kubernetes](https://github.com/swisscom/terraform-dcs-kubernetes) terraform module and is used in the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/swisscom/terraform-dcs-kubernetes/actions) of that project.
